# 🧠 Destination-Zero Core

The **core** repository is the central intelligence engine of [Destination-Zero](https://github.com/Destination-Zero).  
It houses the AI’s cognitive architecture — responsible for **reasoning**, **memory**, **learning**, and **self-adaptation**.

---

## ⚙️ Overview

The core module is designed as a **modular AI framework** that can evolve over time.  
It focuses on simulating an intelligent system capable of perceiving input, storing context, reasoning logically, and adapting based on feedback.

**Key subsystems:**
- **Perception:** Converts raw input (text, image, data streams) into structured representations.  
- **Memory:** Stores experiences and facts in both short-term (vector) and long-term (graph) memory.  
- **Reasoning:** Handles inference, planning, and decision-making using symbolic and neural methods.  
- **Learning:** Enables reflection, feedback analysis, and model adaptation for continuous growth.

## 🧩 Architecture

Input → Perception → Understanding → Memory → Reasoning → Action


Each stage operates as a loosely coupled module, allowing iterative replacement or upgrading without affecting the rest of the system.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

| Area | Tools / Libraries |
|------|--------------------|
| **Core Framework** | Python 3.11+, FastAPI (optional interface) |
| **Reasoning** | PyTorch, LangChain, OpenAI/Local LLMs |
| **Memory** | FAISS / Chroma / Redis, Neo4j for graph knowledge |
| **Logging & Config** | Python `logging`, dotenv |

## 🚀 Setup

### 1. Clone
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Destination-Zero/core.git
cd core
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Or install in editable mode:
```bash
pip install -e .
```

### 3. Run Tests
```bash
pytest
```

### 🧪 Example Usage

```python
from core.reasoning.logic_engine import Reasoner
from core.memory.memory_manager import Memory

memory = Memory()
reasoner = Reasoner(memory)

response = reasoner.process("What did we learn yesterday?")
print(response)
```
